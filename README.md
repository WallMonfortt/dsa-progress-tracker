# DSA Progress Tracker üöÄ

A personalized dashboard to supercharge my Data Structures & Algorithms practice for technical interviews.

## üî• About The Project

This is my personal version of a tool designed to track progress on coding platforms like NeetCode and LeetCode. While it began as a fork, it is now evolving to include specific features tailored to my study routine and interview preparation goals.

The objective is to create an all-in-one tool that not only logs solved problems but also facilitates active recall and helps identify areas for improvement.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## ‚ú® Key Features

* ‚úÖ **Visual Tracking:** Log completed problems across various categories (Arrays, Graphs, DP, etc.).
* ‚úÖ **Automatic Sync:** Progress is saved automatically to the browser's local storage.
* ‚úèÔ∏è **Note-Taking System (In Progress):** A dedicated section for each problem to add personal notes, time/space complexity (Big O), and solution approaches.
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Practice Timer (Planned):** A feature to time problem-solving sessions, simulating real interview conditions.
* üè∑Ô∏è **Custom Tags (Planned):** A system to tag problems with labels like "Review in 7 days," "Tricky," or "Favorite."

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
* npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
